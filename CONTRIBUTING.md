## Contributing to the Build for Black Lives website

If you see a problem with or have a suggestion for our website, please either open an Issue in this repo or reach out to an organizer on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/northeastern-hac3935/shared_invite/zt-fctqwcqe-7~n_GXliEYbQzUeqERHH6A). This website is built using React and Bootstrap. To work on the website, please fork this repository ([instructions here](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)). You should be able to make changes to all the pages other than the projects pages without an Airtable API key. Please reach out to @felicia or @caroline on Slack if you do need project access, or if you have any other questions. Once your changes are ready, open a pull request with `dev` as the base branch. Thank you for your help!
