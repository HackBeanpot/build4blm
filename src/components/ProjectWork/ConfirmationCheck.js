      <h4>Before you take on this project</h4>
      <p>
        The tech and design industries come with a history of discrimination and racism that persists today. This
        appears in products that are designed with racial bias and that exclude black communities, and in the lack of
        diversity in the teams that create these products. To participate in the Build for Black Lives intiative, it is
        critical to be consciously anti-racist and to create work and participate in this process in a way that actively
        supports and empowers black people. Be willing to listen, be respectful and empathetic of your project ownersâ€™
        needs, and trust in the voices of the people you are working with and seek to empower their message rather than
        your own.
