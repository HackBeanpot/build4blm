## Instructions for working on Build for Black Lives repo: 
- Master branch: production-ready site that gets deployed. Merging should only happen from development to master.
- Development branch: branch for developers to merge in their features as they are completed. PR should be made from feature branch to develop.
- Feature branches: Each developer should make a new branch for their work from the development branch in the following format: `cari` (lowercase first name). Make a pull request into develop after your work has been completed. Please note that new experimental changes to your code should not be made when a PR is open.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Shared styles
The `h1, h2, h3 and p` tags match the character styles from ther [XD designs](https://xd.adobe.com/view/cfe9fc7e-8850-42aa-a713-de8009844536-9aba/) and for the most part should be the only ones used without needing additional custom styling.

All `Button`s should use either the `primary-button` or `secondary-button` classNames for the yellow and blue buttons respectively.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
